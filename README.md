# JourneyV2

##TODO
  * Add game states PRIORITY
  * Add enemy PRIORITY
  * Add enemy AI
  * Make level 2

##What is Journey?
Journey is a game made by Maarten Wachters using some self made, and some free assets. It's goal is to be an basic platformer which I can expand upon whenever I further my knowledge of C#. 
The game as of now is geared towards my class Game Development, but I want to rewrite it from scratch, applying SOLID principles and porting it to android.

##What are some things you want to implement?
* Good hero AI
* Fixing / tweaking colission detection. Handeling this in 1 class.
* Applying SOLID Principles
* Expand upon it with self-made assets
* Porting to Android
